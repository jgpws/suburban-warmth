Suburban Warmth is a Sandbox child theme and is dependent on it to function. In order to use this theme, you must download the Sandbox theme (if you don't already have it). You can download Sandbox at http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/ and install it to your theme directory, similar to in the above instructions.


Adsense Specific Instructions:

Suburban Warmth was designed to be Adsense friendly for those who wish to place ads on their pages and within posts. To do this in the easiest way, I took advantage of WordPress shortcodes. To find out more, see http://blog.themeforest.net/wordpress/9-useful-snippets-for-your-wordpress-functions/ and http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/02/mastering-wordpress-shortcodes/.

This theme currently supports Adsense Square, Skyscraper and Button style ads. Four screenshots in this theme's images folder named adsense_example1.jpg, adsense_example2.jpg, adsense_example3.jpg and adsense_example4.jpg show how these will look on the page in the form of placeholders.

To replace the placeholder images, go to functions.php. Replace the image tags with your Adsense code (generated by Google). For example in the function below:

<?php 
//adsense placeholder functions and shortcodes
function show250left() { 
return '<div class="ad250-floatleft"><img src="' . get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory') . '/images/ad_placeholder250.png" alt="Adsense 250 placeholder" /></div>';
}
add_shortcode('ad250-floatleft', 'show250left');

<?php 
function show250left() {
return '<div id="ad250-floatleft"> Paste Adsense code for a 250 by 250 Square ad here. </div>';
}

To place ads within posts or pages, use the following shortcodes anywhere on the page or post:

[ad250-floatleft]
[ad250-floatright]
[ad468-center]
[ad125button]
[ad120tower]

Adsense Sizes in This Theme:

ad250-floatleft refers to a left aligned Square ad with text flowing around
ad250-floatright refers to a right aligned Square ad with text flowing around
ad468-center refers to a centered Banner ad
ad125button refers to a centered Button ad
ad120tower refers to a centered Skyscraper ad

To use the placeholder images in the sidebar widget, you must upload the images to your Media folder in WordPress's Admin panel (if you have administrator priveleges). We will use the 120 pixel tower image as an example.

* From the Media section, click Add New, Select Files and navigate to this theme's images folder (directory-where-wordpress-is-installed/wp-content/themes/suburban-warmth/images)
* Select the file ad_placeholder120.png
* At the bottom, you will see a File URL; copy the URL from the image and paste into the appropriate <img src> tags within the functions.php file. For example: <img src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ad_placeholder120.png">
* Note that the URL from your Media panel may be significantly different from the one above

The 120 wide pixel tower ad can be added directly (hard-coded) to a non-widgetized sidebar or portion of the sidebar, but what if you want to add it to a Text widget in the sidebar? Simply drag the Text widget into Sidebar 1 (or Sidebar 2) and copy and paste the following code into the Text box:

<div id="ad-120tower">
<img src="http://domain-name/directory-where-worpdress-is-installed/wp-content/uploads/[year]/[month]/ad_placeholder120.png">
</div>

The placeholder image in the above example would be from your Media folder. Replace the image <img src="..."> tag with your generated code.
